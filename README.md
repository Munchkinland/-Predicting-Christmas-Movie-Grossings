# Predicting Christmas Movie Grossings

## üìñ Background

Imagine harnessing the power of data science to unveil the hidden potential of movies before they even hit the silver screen! As a data scientist at a forward-thinking cinema, you're at the forefront of an exhilarating challenge: crafting a cutting-edge system that doesn't just predict movie revenues, but reshapes the entire landscape of cinema profitability. This isn't just about numbers; it's about blending art with analytics to revolutionize how movies are marketed, chosen, and celebrated.

Your mission? To architect a predictive model that dives deep into the essence of a movie - from its title and running time to its genre, captivating description, and star-studded cast. And what better way to sprinkle some festive magic on this project than by focusing on a dataset brimming with Christmas movies? A highly-anticipated Christmas movie is due to launch soon, but the cinema has some doubts. It wants you to predict its success, so it can decide whether to go ahead with the screening or not. It's a unique opportunity to blend the cheer of the holiday season with the rigor of data science, creating insights that could guide the success of tomorrow's blockbusters. Ready to embark on this cinematic adventure?

## üí™ Competition challenge

Create a report that covers the following:
1. Exploratory data analysis of the dataset with informative plots. It's up to you what to include here! Some ideas could include:
    * Analysis of the genres

    * Word clouds
2. 
3. Evaluate your model using appropriate metrics.Develop a model to predict the movie's domestic gross based on the available features.
     * Remember to preprocess and clean the data first.
     * Think about what features you could define (feature engineering), e.g.:
       * _number of times a director appeared in the top 1000 movies list_,
       * _highest grossing for lead actor(s)_,
       * _decade released_
